# smjesApp

Welcome to smjesApp, a Flutter project for creating Eastern European specialties. The name "smjesApp" is derived from the Croatian word "smjesa" which translates to "mixture" in English. In this application, we focus on creating a mixture of meat and fat with customizable ingredient ratios based on predefined recipes or user preferences.

## Guide to using the app

On the homepage, we are greeted with a selection of specialties, as well as a "Drawer" with a brief explanation of the application and instructions for use.

When selecting the specialty we want to prepare, a screen opens with three predefined recipes (mild, medium, spicy) and the option to customize the quantity of ingredients with the "Po izboru" button.

On each recipe screen, we first enter the weight of the mixture in kilograms.
The "Po izboru" screen has a text field for each ingredient where we enter the desired percentage relative to the mixture.
The application does not allow entering a mixture weight greater than 999 kilograms but allows decimal places for more precise input. Additionally, on the "Po izboru" screen, it does not allow entering an ingredient greater than 99%. The results are displayed in grams up to 1000g, after which the result is displayed in kilograms.

On some screens, we have a Floating Action Button that contains instructions for preparing the specialty.
